# LIRI-Node-App

###Overview:

For this assignment, the objective was to create command line interface akin to Apple's Siri. Through the use of multiple functions and inquirer prompts the program is able to retreive and display data such as concert, song and movie details based on the user generated inputs of artist/band names, song titles and movie titles respectively.

###Design Notes:

The file loads and then enters a command line prompt. The user is given four choices: concert-this, spotify-this, movie-this and do-what-it-says. Each option corresponds to a unique funciton. The concert-this function takes in an artist/band name as input and displays details about their nevt five events. The spotify-this function takes a user generated song title and prints out song related details about said song. The movie-this function uses a movie title input by the user and again displays basic movie information. The do-what-it-says function will randomly pick from the functions listed above and then prompt the user to fill out the necessary inputs. All functions are capable of receiving user generated text and empty strings.
